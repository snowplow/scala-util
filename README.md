# Scala Util [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/snowplow/scala-util.png)](https://travis-ci.org/snowplow/scala-util)

A fistful of idiosyncratic, small general-purpose tools for Scala. Inspired by Twitter's own [Util] [twitter-util] project.

# Installation

Add this to your SBT config:

```scala
// Resolver
val snowplowRepo = "SnowPlow Repo" at "http://maven.snplow.com/releases/"

// Dependency
val scalaUtil = "com.snowplowanalytics"   % "util"   % "0.1.0" 
```

## Quick start

### Tap

Ruby-style `tap()` for all objects. See [this blog post] [tap-blog] for background.

```scala
import com.snowplowanalytics.util.Tap._
val event = new SnowPlowEvent().tap { e =>
  e.mkt_medium = "cpc"
  e.mkt_source = null
  e.mkt_term = "buy scifi books"
  e.mkt_content = null
  e.mkt_campaign = "uk-fiction--scifi-books-text"
}
```

### More soon

More tools coming soon...
